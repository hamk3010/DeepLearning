# ML-Algos ðŸ¤–
ML-Algos covers fundamental machine learning algorithms with Scikit-Learn to clarify the basics of machine learning so we can build on top of that when we head into deep learning. Most of my examples will be coming straight out of the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow I provide the readers a Jupyter notebook and a Colab link so they can run the examples themselves and play around with different hyperparameters and see how each effects the model.
