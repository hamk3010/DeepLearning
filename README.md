# DeepLearning ðŸ§ 

:octocat: In this repository I will put links for Deep Learning/Machine Learning resources that I find online as I learn more about the subject. I will also try to attach a Colab reference on each of my iPython notebooks so the work can be reproduced later. Some examples will come from the books as I use them for reference.

## Machine-Learning ðŸ¤–
* [ML-Algos](https://github.com/hamk3010/DeepLearning/blob/master/ML-Algos) covers fundamental machine learning algorithms and provides resources to help you refresh some basic machine learning concepts. If you feel like you require some refreshers on ML it is a good idea to check out ML-Algos which uses Python's Scikit-Learn to cover some essential machine learning concepts.

## Books :closed_book:
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=7H6E517DX2N5P5NT0345)
* [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438)

## Courses
   One good thing aout Coursera is they provide a great financial aid application if you can't afford the course make sure you click on their financial aid application. Coursera has a strong financial aid program, so you can essentially get certificates for the entire Deep Learning specialization for cheap. 
### Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization:
